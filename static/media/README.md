## These are the /media gallery assets

Upload images here and they'll show up on https://www.deadlinefornetneutrality.com/media/

All images must be in a gallery folder. You can give a gallery a title and description by adding a [data.json file](https://github.com/fightforthefuture/deadlinefornetneutrality.com/blob/master/static/media/banners/data.json) to the folder.

            The FCC officially gutted the open internet, allowing your cable company
            to scam you for more money, censor websites, and slow down online content.
            By electing Senators and Representatives who support net neutrality, we
            can reverse the FCCâ€™s decision and enshrine net neutrality protections
            into law. Use these great profile pictures and banner ads to spread the
